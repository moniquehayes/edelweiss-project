## Tech Stack: 
    - React
    - HTML
    - CSS
    - React Bootstrap

I began the assignment using Create React App. I initially started using React-Redux and Axios as well, but in the end I decided to not use these. 

## Troubleshot: 
- Some products didn't have the image urls listed, so I added a filler image for any that didn't have one. If I had more time, I would have liked to also troubleshoot the product images whose urls were 404 (i.e. 'This is a very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very long title') 
- I tried using Axios to fetch the api data and was not able to fetch it. I would have liked to troubleshoot this further, but due to the time constraint I decided to just add a file of the raw data - catalog-data.js
- I would have also loved to play around with the fonts used if I had more time!
